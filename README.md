# Code-for-EESM-log-SGN-PHY-abstraction-with-imperfect-CSI
This GitHub contains all code necessary to implement the EESM-log-SGN PHY abstraction with imperfect CSI. This continues the prior work 
[1] S. Jin, S. Roy, and T. R. Henderson, “Efficient PHY layer abstraction for fast simulations in complex system environments,” IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 69, no. 8, pp. 5649–5660, 2021.

This code can be used to generate the effective SINR with the corresponding log=SGN-parameter under specific PHY layer configurations, e.g., channel type, OFDM MIMO setup, MCS and channel coding. The scenarios include
1) Downlink OFDM Single BSS SU-MIMO 
2) Downlink OFDM Multi-BSS SU-MIMO

In addition, this code provides two methods (i.e., simulation based method and analysis based method) to implement the EESM-log-SGN PHY abstraction with imperfect CSI under the scenario of Downlink OFDM Single BSS SU-MIMO.
