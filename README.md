# Code-for-EESM-log-SGN-PHY-abstraction-with-imperfect-CSI
This GitHub contains all code necessary to implement the EESM-log-SGN PHY abstraction with imperfect CSI. This continues the prior work

This code can be used to generate the log=SGN-parameter with impefect CSI given PHY layer configurations, e.g., channel type, OFDM MIMO setup, MCS and channel coding. The scenarios include
1) DL OFDM Single BSS SU-MIMO 
2) DL OFDM Multi-BSS SU-MIMO

In addition, this code provides two methods (i.e., simulation based method and analysis based method) to the log=SGN-parameter with impefect CSI under the scenario of DL OFDM Single BSS SU-MIMO.
